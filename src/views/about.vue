			About
		</h2>

		<p class="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
			Learning does not always have to feel like studying and that is exactly what my app is built around.
			Instead of following the usual classroom style, this app takes a task based learning approach where practice
			happens naturally and indirectly. Users are not forced into long lessons, instead they are invited to
			complete fun
			challenges that encourage curiosity, problem solving, and exploration in a playful way.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
			The app is made for everyone. There is no specific age group or profession required. Students can use it to
			build study habits, professionals can use it to sharpen their thinking, and anyone can use it simply for fun
			and self improvement. The idea is simple, anyone who spends just a few minutes a day with the app can
			benefit.

			<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Daily Practice</h3>
			<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
				Each day users are encouraged to complete small tasks like finding answers, reading a short text,
				or thinking about a simple question. Over time these small efforts add up, creating strong learning
				habits
				without the stress of formal study.

			<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">Daily Scoring System</h3>
			<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
				To make the journey more engaging, the app also has a daily scoring system. Each completed task adds to
				your score,
				and you can track your progress over time. The scoring system motivates users to keep going, build
				streaks, and
				challenge themselves to improve a little every day, turning learning into a rewarding game.

		<p class="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
			This app is not about memorization, exams, or pressure. It is about creating a space where curiosity and
			practice go
			hand in hand. By engaging daily and seeing your progress grow, users discover that learning can be part of
			everyday
			life, done in small steps, and enjoyed like a daily habit.
		</p>

		<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
			Over time, these small daily practices lead to bigger results. They help sharpen the mind, improve problem
			solving
			skills, build consistency, and make reading and exploring ideas an enjoyable part of life. The app is more
			than just
			a tool, it is a companion for building lifelong learning habits in a simple, fun, and motivating way.
